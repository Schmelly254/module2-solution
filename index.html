<h1>*****Dylan's Solution Attempt*****</h1>
<h2>Hello! Welcome to my page attempt!</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <div id="box1">Solid</div>
    <p>strong intermolecular forces,particles vibrate in place,low kinetic energy (KE)definite shape,definite volume,incompressible,high density (as compared to same substance as a liquid or gas),low rate of diffusion (millions of times slower than in liquids)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <div id="box2">Liquid</div>
    <p>Liquid has a fixed volume but no fixed shape.Liquids can be slightly compressed. large pressure is required to compress them.Liquids have lesser densities than solids.Intermolecular forces of attraction is weaker than solids.They have considerable space between the particles</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
    <div id="box3">Gas</div>
    <p>Gases have neither definite shape nor definite volume. They expand to the size of their container. Gases are fluid, and flow easily.Gases have low density, unless compressed. Gases diffuse (mix and spread out) and effuse (travel through small holes)</p>
